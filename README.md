# Scout.app

A macOS companion app for the [Scout](https://github.com/jordanrburger/scout-plugin) Claude Code plugin.

Scout is an autonomous knowledge-management and daily-briefing system that runs as scheduled Claude Code sessions. The plugin does the work; this app gives you a native interface on top of whatever Scout produces in `~/Scout/`:

- **Control Center** — sessions activity, upcoming schedule, recent runs with cost/status, usage heatmap.
- **Action Items** — today's to-do list rendered from the daily markdown file, with inline comments and deep links to Linear / GitHub PRs / Slack threads.
- **Schedules** — full CRUD on the `com.scout.*.plist` launchd agents: edit fire times, add a new schedule, pause or remove existing ones. Saves to both the live copy in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and the repo copy in `~/Scout/launchd/`, reloads via `launchctl`, and commits the repo change.

## Install (prebuilt DMG)

The fastest path if you just want to run the app:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/jordanrburger/Scout/releases) page and download the latest `Scout-*.dmg`.
2. Open the DMG and drag **Scout.app** into the **Applications** folder.
3. First launch only: macOS will refuse because the build is ad-hoc signed (no paid Apple Developer cert). Right-click **Scout.app** in `/Applications` → **Open** → **Open**. After that it launches normally.
4. Press ⌘, to open Settings and fill in your Linear workspace and author name.

The app expects a Scout instance at `~/Scout/`. Install the [scout-plugin](https://github.com/jordanrburger/scout-plugin) into Claude Code and run `/scout-setup` first if you don't have one yet.

## Requirements (for building from source)

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer.
- Xcode 15 or newer (for build + codesign).
- An existing Scout instance at `~/Scout/`.

## Build & run

```bash
open Scout.xcodeproj
# In Xcode: Product → Run (⌘R)
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme Scout -destination 'platform=macOS' build
xcodebuild -scheme Scout -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

### Dev build vs. release build (running both side by side)

Debug and Release builds use **different bundle identifiers** on purpose, so you can keep the stable app from the DMG installed in `/Applications` and simultaneously run a development copy out of Xcode without either one clobbering the other.

| Config | Bundle ID | Display name | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release (DMG install) | `com.scout.Scout` | Scout | `/Applications/Scout.app` |
| Debug (Xcode ⌘R) | `com.scout.Scout.dev` | Scout Dev | `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../Debug/Scout.app` |

Because the bundle IDs differ, they have **separate `UserDefaults`, separate menu-bar icons, and separate "Launch at login" registrations**. They still read/write the same `~/Scout/` directory — that's the intended shared state, since your dev build should see your real Scout data.

Typical workflow: keep "Scout" running from `/Applications` all day, and spin up "Scout Dev" from Xcode whenever you want to try a change. Quit the dev copy when you're done; the stable app keeps running unaffected.

## First-run configuration

Cmd+, opens Settings. A few fields are worth filling in:

- **Launch Scout at login** — start the app automatically so it's watching your Scout instance all day.
- **Scout directory** — read-only display. The app assumes `~/Scout` (the scout-plugin default).
- **Linear workspace** — your Linear workspace slug (e.g. `acme-co`). Used to build Linear URLs when you click a `[[PROJ-123]]` wikilink or deep link in an action item. Leave blank to open `linear.app` without a workspace.
- **Your name** — shown next to comments you add to action items. Defaults to `user`.

## Repo layout

```
Scout/                 # main target source
  ActionItems/         # parser, writer, views for daily action-items markdown
  ControlCenter/       # sessions dashboard
  Models/              # shared types (Run, Schedule, CalendarFire, …)
  Schedules/           # list + detail views for launchd schedules
  Services/            # file watcher, git, launchctl, plist I/O, schedule editor
  Shell/               # AppState, sidebar, main window, settings
ScoutTests/            # unit + integration tests (~120 tests)
docs/                  # design specs
```

## Development

Tests run from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme Scout -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

Or a specific suite:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme Scout -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:ScoutTests/ScheduleEditorServiceSaveTests
```

The `ScoutTests/Fixtures/` directory holds synthetic plists, logs, and action-items files used by the suite. Nothing in them references a real person or incident.

## Cutting a release

Maintainers: `scripts/release.sh <version>` builds a universal (arm64+x86_64) ad-hoc-signed DMG, tags `v<version>`, pushes the tag, and creates a GitHub Release with the DMG attached. Example:

```bash
scripts/release.sh 0.2.0
```

Set `SKIP_RELEASE=1` to build the DMG locally without tagging or uploading.

## Relationship to the plugin

The plugin writes; the app reads (and occasionally writes back via CLI shims for action-item comments and schedule edits). The plugin owns:

- Session scheduling via `com.scout.*.plist` launchd agents.
- Daily action-items markdown at `~/Scout/action-items/action-items-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Session logs at `~/Scout/.scout-logs/*.log`.
- Usage tracking at `~/Scout/.scout-logs/usage-tracker.jsonl`.
- Commit history in `~/Scout/.git`.

The app is a pure consumer of all of the above, plus:

- Saves comment edits via the plugin's `action-items/add_comment.py` CLI.
- Saves schedule edits by writing plists directly and running `launchctl bootout`/`bootstrap`.

If the plugin isn't installed, the app still builds and runs; it just shows empty views.
